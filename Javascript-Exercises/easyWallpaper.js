/*Description:
John wants to decorate a room with wallpaper. He has been said that making sure he has the right amount of wallpaper is more complex than it sounds. He wants a fool-proof method to getting it right.

John knows that the rectangular room has a length of l meters, a width of w meters, a height of h meters. The standard width of the rolls he wants to buy is 52 centimeters. The length of a roll is 10 meters. He bears in mind however, that itâ€™s best to have an extra length of wallpaper handy in case of mistakes or miscalculations so he wants to buy a length 15% greater than the one he needs.

Last time he did these calculations he caught a headache so could you help John? Your function wallpaper(l, w, h) should return as a plain English word in lower case the number of rolls he must buy.

#Example: wallpaper(4, 3.5, 3) should return "ten"

#Notes:

all rolls (even with incomplete width) are put edge to edge
0 <= l, w, h (floating numbers), it can happens that w x h x l is zero
the integer r (number of rolls) will always be less or equal to 20

const wallpaper = (l, w, h) => {
    if (w * h * l === 0) {
        return numbers[0];
    } else {
        const notRoundedArea = ((l * h * 2 + w * h * 2) * 1.15) / 5.2;
        const areaPosition = Math.ceil(notRoundedArea);
        return numbers[areaPosition];
    }

console.log(wallpaper(6.3, 4.5, 3.29));
